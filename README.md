If you have a teacher who teaches one subject the root variable is the teachers name capitalized. If the teaher has more add the abrevition of said topics (except the most regular one he / she teaches)  to the front of the variable in all caps to get the root, do this for each topic individually. If the teacher Dragon teaches biology, chemistry nd ainly physics the roots are Dragon, CHEMDragon, and BIODragon. To get the day variable add "day" to the end of the root.
